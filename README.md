This is my solution to the Codewars Kata [Company Data - totals per day](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sql-data-company-data-totals-per-day/train/sql)

The challenge is to produce a query that calculates for each day how many hours have been
clocked up by each department.


For example:

       day        department_name total_hours
    2018-06-28      Clothing           48
    2018-06-28      Home                8
    2018-06-28      Jewelry             8
    2018-06-28      Shoes              48
    2018-06-28      Tools              16
    2018-06-29      Clothing            8
    2018-06-29      Home               32
    2018-06-29      Jewelry            40
